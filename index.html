          <h2>Daily Code Journaling</h2>
          <p>
            How many of us remember our elementary school journaling time? My
            teacher would give daily writing prompts for those who needed to get
            their creative juices going, but if you already had inspiration for
            the day, you were welcome to follow that inspiration as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have begun to approach my code study with this journaling mindset.
            Every day, I sit down and write code. It doesn't matter what I
            write. It only matters that I put content on screen the way I would
            put words on paper as a child.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my journaling time, I try to write several lines of CSS. I
            aim to make it pretty. Sometimes I add animation. Other times I
            incorporate special fonts and icons or put a photo as the background
            to my header. I like to watch design courses on Linkedin, Udemy or
            Skillshare to up my style game.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes I spin up a full React project and other times I simply
            work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. No matter what kind of project I'm working on, I aim to commit daily.

          <ul>
            <li>Share a favorite recipe. Take some photos. Make a video.</li>
            <li>
              Do some photo journalism. Tell the story of an event in photos.

            <li>
              Create some data with an array of objects and then filter, format
              and present it on the page.

            <li>
              Create a React project and hook up the navigation with React
              Router and React Bootstrap. Put some basic content on each page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build a form. Use emailJS to actually send that form to your
              email.
